What is a relational database?

A relational database is a digital database whose organisation is based on the data of a relational model.

What is a relational model?

A relational model organises data into one or more tables (relations) of collumns and rows, each with its own unique key identifying each row
Rows are commonly referd to as records or tuples.  Generally each table/relation represents one entity type such as "John" or "Chair" and the
collumns representing values attributed to that instance such as address or price.


What are keys?

Each row in a table has its own unique key. Foreign keys are other columns linked by these unique keys.

Primary Key - PK
Alternate Key - AK

Primary keys are used within a database to define the relationships among tables. When a PK migrates to another table, it becomes a foreign key in the other table.


Relationships are a logical connection between different tables, established on the basis of interaction among these tables.
